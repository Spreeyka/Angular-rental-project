# Angular-rental-project

Project done for one of my study classes. The goal was to make application which simulates old-fashioned rental service for games. It contains server done in typescript (node.js, mongoDb, express) with some basic tests and frontend done in Angular (Angular material)

you need to initialize mongoDb database with mongod command done in cmd - you might need to create environment variable for that\
